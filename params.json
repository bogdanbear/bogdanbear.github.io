I have graduated my first year of master with a thesis on shortest vector problem solvers, carried out under the supervision of Prof. Serge Vaudenay, at the EPFL. Before, I have obtained my Bachelor of Computer Science from University Alexandru Ioan Cuza of Iasi, where I have worked with Prof. Ferucio Laurentiu Tiplea. As an undergraduate Erasmus student, I have also followed the research master in cryptography at Université Joseph-Fourier, most notably the courses on elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography taught by Ms. Vanessa Vitse.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Thesis\r\nFirst year of master research internship\r\n\r\n\r\nDiploma thesis\r\n\r\n\r\n### Curriculum Vitae\r\nIt can be found [here](https://bogdanbear.github.io/resources/cv.pdf))\r\n\r\n",
