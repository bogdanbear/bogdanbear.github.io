I have graduated my first year of master with a thesis on shortest vector problem solvers, carried out under the supervision of Prof. Serge Vaudenay, at the EPFL. Before, I have obtained my Bachelor of Computer Science from University Alexandru Ioan Cuza of Iasi, where I have worked with Prof. Ferucio Laurentiu Tiplea. As an undergraduate Erasmus student, I have also followed the research master in cryptography at Université Joseph-Fourier, most notably the courses on elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography taught by Ms. Vanessa Vitse. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Thesis\r\nFirst year of master research internship    \r\n\r\nSieving Algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem, supervised by Prof. Serge Vaudenay     \r\n\r\n[Report](https://bogdanbear.github.io/projects/Bogdan_Ursu_M1_Report .pdf) [Slides](https://bogdanbear.github.io/projects/Bogdan_Ursu_M1_Slides.pdf)     \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDiploma thesis    \r\n\r\nFactorization and DLP in a Subexponential Setting, supervised by Prof. F.L.
