<p><img src="https://bogdanbear.github.io/resources/cvcachan.png" alt="Me" width="200" height="200"><br>
I am a second year master student at <a href="http://www.ens-cachan.fr/"><strong><code>École Normale Supérieure de Cachan</code></strong></a>, where I follow the <a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php">Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science</a>. My main directions of study are cryptography, along with complexity and computability. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have graduated my first year of master with a thesis on shortest vector problem solvers, carried out under the supervision of Prof. Serge Vaudenay, at the <a href="http://lasec.epfl.ch/"><strong><code>EPFL</code></strong></a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Before, I have obtained my Bachelor of Computer Science from <strong><code>University Alexandru Ioan Cuza</code></strong> of Iasi, where I have worked with Prof. Ferucio Laurentiu Tiplea. </p></li>
<li><p>As an undergraduate Erasmus student, I have also followed the <a href="http://cybersecurity.imag.fr/">research master in cryptography</a> at <strong><code>Université Joseph-Fourier</code></strong>, most notably the courses on elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography taught by Ms. Vanessa Vitse. </p></li>

<p><strong>First year of master research internship</strong>    </p>

<p><strong>Sieving Algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem, supervised by Prof. Serge Vaudenay</strong>     </p>

<p>During this internship, I have studied algorithms for solving the shortest vector problem in generic Euclidean lattices. I have surveyed both provable and heuristic approaches, principally the AKS, the NV-Sieve and its improvements using locality sensitive-hashing. I have also proposed an improved analysis for the case of the approximate shortest vector problem. </p>

<p><strong>Diploma thesis</strong>    </p>

<p><strong>Factorization and DLP in a Subexponential Setting, supervised by Prof. F.L. Tiplea</strong>      </p>

<p>During this project, I have mainly studied Gaudry's index calculus attack for hyperelliptic curves of small genus, along with an improvement proposed by Thériault. Providing an implementation requires a known cardinality of the Jacobian. To this end, I have generated my own hyperelliptic curves using a method proposed by Koblitz to construct curves with easily computable Jacobian cardinality, by means of the associated zeta function. </p>

<p><strong>AcRe - Academic Gossip-Based Recommender</strong></p>

<p>Webpage dedicated to the aggregation of academic results from previous years, along with social media comments on specific courses. This with the purpose of providing feedback to prospective students. Also performs sentiment analysis on social media comments. Implemented in ASP.NET using MongoDB, in a team of two students. </p>

<p><strong>DES Cracker</strong></p>

<p>Implementation of a toy DES cracker using the Hellman and Rivest methods for obtaining time-memory trade-offs, along with comparisons of the two approaches. This project was carried out while at UJF Grenoble and was implemented in C++ in a team of two students.</p>
